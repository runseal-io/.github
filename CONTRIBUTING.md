# Contributing to RunSeal

Thanks for helping! This org-wide guide applies unless a repo has its own CONTRIBUTING.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`
2. Run tests/lint locally.
3. Submit a PR to `main` with a clear title and description.
4. Ensure checks pass; a maintainer will review.

## Code Style
- Python: black + ruff (see repo configs)
- JS/TS: eslint + prettier
- Commit messages: Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`)

## DCO/CLA
By contributing, you agree your contribution is your own work and you grant it under the repoâ€™s license. Repos may require DCO sign-off.

## Issues
- **Bug report:** use the Bug template and include reproduction steps.
- **Feature request:** explain the use case and proposed API.
